## Guidelines for Git and GitHub

Version control is your rocket fuel for efficient collaboration and progress tracking. Letâ€™s navigate the Git and GitHub galaxy together:

### **Git Basics**

1. **Initialize Your Rocket:**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. **Branching Across Stars:**
   - Create a branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
     - Example: `feature/add-login`, `bugfix/fix-api`
3. **Committing Milestones:**
   - Commit often with clear messages: `git commit -m "Fix: Resolve API timeout issue"`
4. **Push for Orbit:**
   - Push your branch to the remote repository: `git push origin <branch-name>`

### **GitHub Workflow**

1. **Launch a Pull Request (PR):**
   - PRs are your tickets to peer-reviewed success. Include:
     - Clear title and description.
     - Reference related tickets or issues.
   - Notify reviewers by assigning them in the PR.

2. **Code Reviews:**
   - Review assigned PRs within 24 hours.
   - Provide actionable feedback or approve for merging.

3. **Merge Like a Pro:**
   - Merge only after approval and successful CI/CD checks.

## Ticket Management

Our ticketing system is your flight plan to navigate tasks effectively:

1. **Ticket Creation:**
   - Create tickets for every task, bug, or enhancement.
   - Add descriptive titles, detailed descriptions, and relevant attachments.

2. **Prioritize Missions:**
   - Label tickets as `High Priority`, `Medium Priority`, or `Low Priority` to define urgency.

3. **Track Progress:**
   - Move tickets through stages: `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Code Review`, `Done`.

4. **Celebrate Closure:**
   - Close tickets only when tasks are completed, tested, and approved.

## Debugging Process

Debugging is your superpower to keep systems running smoothly. Hereâ€™s how to harness it:

1. **Replicate the Problem:**
   - Start by reproducing the bug in your local environment.

2. **Analyze Logs:**
   - Dive into server logs, application logs, or console output for error insights.

3. **Use Stellar Tools:**
   - Debug with Chrome DevTools, Postman, or IDE debuggers.

4. **Collaborate:**
   - Reach out for help or pair-program with teammates when stuck.

5. **Document Fixes:**
   - Log the root cause and resolution in the ticket for future reference.
