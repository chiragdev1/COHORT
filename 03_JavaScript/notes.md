### **JavaScript Objects and Memory Concepts**  

#### **Introduction**  
An object is a representation of a real-world entity like a car, person, or laptop. It consists of **key-value pairs**. In JavaScript, almost everything is an instance of an object.

---

### **Creating an Object**  
```javascript
const user = {
   x: 10,
   firstName: 'Chirag',
   lastName: 'Arora',
   age: 23,
};

// console.log(user)
```

---

### **Adding a New Property to the Object**  
```javascript
user.height = 182;
```

---

### **Deleting a Property from the Object**  
```javascript
delete user.lastName;
```

---

### **Copying Objects and the Issue with Reference Assignment**  

#### **Task:**  
- Create `user1` with the given properties.
- Copy `user1` into `user2`.
- Change the `firstName` of `user2` to **Sahil** and print both objects.

```javascript
const user1 = {
   id: 9232,
   firstName: 'Chirag',
   age: 23
}

const user2 = user1;
user2.firstName = 'Sahil'; // Now both user1 and user2 have firstName = Sahil. Why?
```

---

### **Stack vs Heap Memory**  
In JavaScript, memory is managed in two ways:  

1. **Stack Memory**: Stores variables with static values (`string`, `number`, `boolean`).  
2. **Heap Memory**: Stores objects and arrays (dynamic structures).  

When we assign `user2 = user1`, JavaScript copies the **reference (address)** of `user1` into `user2`. Both `user1` and `user2` now point to the same object in the heap.

---

### **Solution: Creating an Independent Copy Using Spread Operator**  
The **spread operator (`...`)** helps create a new object with a separate memory reference.

```javascript
const user3 = {
   ...user1
};
user3.firstName = 'Chirag'; // Now both user1 and user3 have different memory addresses.
```

---

### **Shallow Copy Issue with Nested Objects**  
What if we add an **object** as a property inside `user1`?

```javascript
user1.address = {
   h: 2,
   s: 21,
   city: 'Delhi'
};

const user4 = {
   ...user1
};

// Changing address in user4
user4.address.h = 45; 
```

#### **Problem:**
The change is reflected in both `user1` and `user4`. Why?  
- The spread operator only performs a **shallow copy**, meaning:
  - Static values (like `firstName`, `age`) get a new address.
  - **Nested objects (like `address`) still share the same memory reference**.

---

### **Deep Copy Solution Using JSON**  
To fully clone an object (including nested objects), we can use **JSON serialization**.

```javascript
// Step 1: Convert user1 into a JSON string
const user1KaString = JSON.stringify(user1);

// Step 2: Convert the string back into an object
const user5 = JSON.parse(user1KaString);

// Changing address in user5
user5.address.h = 99; // Now, user1 remains unchanged.
```

---

### **Serialization & Deserialization**  
- **Serialization**: Converting an object into a string (e.g., `JSON.stringify()`).  
- **Deserialization**: Converting a string back into an object (e.g., `JSON.parse()`).  

---

### **Final Output**
```javascript
console.log(user1);
console.log(user1KaString);
console.log(user5);
```

---

### **Conclusion**  
- **Shallow copy**: Uses the spread operator (`...`), but nested objects still share memory.  
- **Deep copy**: Uses `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` to create a fully independent copy.  

Hope this helps! ðŸš€

# Understanding JavaScript Prototypes Through Arrays

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language, but some of its concepts can be a bit confusing, especially for beginners. One such concept is **prototypes**. To understand how prototypes work, letâ€™s break it down using a simple example involving arrays.

---

## Letâ€™s Start with an Array

Consider the following code:

```javascript
const mySkills = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'Javascript'];
```

Here, weâ€™ve created an array called `mySkills` that holds three strings. Arrays are one of the most commonly used data structures in JavaScript, and they come with a lot of built-in functionality.

---

## Adding an Element to the Array

Now, letâ€™s add another element to this array using the `push()` method:

```javascript
mySkills.push('Tailwind CSS');
```

After this line executes, `mySkills` will look like this:

```javascript
['HTML', 'CSS', 'Javascript', 'Tailwind CSS']
```

---

## Breaking Down the Code

At first glance, this seems straightforward, but letâ€™s analyze this line carefully:

```javascript
mySkills.push('Tailwind CSS');
```

### Why Are We Using a Dot (.) to Access `push`?

In JavaScript, the dot notation (`.`) is typically used to access properties or methods of an object. For example:

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
console.log(person.name); // Accessing the 'name' property
```

So, why are we using `.` to access the `push()` method on an array? This brings us to an important realization: **in JavaScript, everything is an object**.

---

## Arrays Are Objects Too

Yes, you read that right! Arrays in JavaScript are essentially objects under the hood. This is why we can use dot notation to access methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `slice()`, and so on. These methods are part of the array objectâ€™s prototype.

---

## Where Do These Methods Come From?

Hereâ€™s where things get interesting. We never defined the `push()` method ourselves, nor did we explicitly create the `Array` object. So, how does JavaScript know what `push()` does?

This is where **prototypes** come into play.

---

## What Are Prototypes?

In JavaScript, every object has a hidden property called `[[Prototype]]` (often referred to as the prototype). This prototype is like a blueprint that defines the methods and properties available to that object.

When you create an array, JavaScript automatically sets up its prototype to be `Array.prototype`. This `Array.prototype` object contains all the built-in methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and more.

So, when you call `mySkills.push('Tailwind CSS')`, JavaScript looks for the `push()` method on the `mySkills` array. If it doesnâ€™t find it directly on the array, it looks up the prototype chain and finds it on `Array.prototype`.

---

## Why Are Prototypes Useful?

Imagine having to write all the logic for every array operation from scratch. Youâ€™d need to write functions to add elements, remove elements, iterate over arrays, and so on. This would be time-consuming and repetitive.

Thankfully, JavaScriptâ€™s prototype system saves us from this hassle. Someone (the creators of JavaScript) has already written these methods for us and attached them to the `Array.prototype`. This allows us to use these methods effortlessly, making our code cleaner and more efficient.

---

## A Quick Recap

1. **Arrays are objects**: In JavaScript, arrays are a type of object, which is why we can use dot notation to access their methods.
2. **Prototypes are blueprints**: Every object in JavaScript has a prototype that defines its methods and properties.
3. **Built-in methods come from prototypes**: Methods like `push()`, `pop()`, and `map()` are defined on `Array.prototype`, which is why we can use them on any array.

---

## Final Thoughts

Prototypes are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, and understanding them can help you write better, more efficient code. They allow JavaScript to be a highly flexible and powerful language, enabling us to build complex applications without reinventing the wheel.

So, the next time you use an array method like `push()`, remember that itâ€™s all thanks to prototypes working behind the scenes!
