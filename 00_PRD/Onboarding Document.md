## 🔑 Git and GitHub Made Easy

Think of Git as your tea recipe book and GitHub as the shelf where you store all your recipes online. Here’s how to use them:

### **🍃 Git Basics (Your Recipe Book)**

1. **Start Fresh:**
   - Get the code: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. **Branch Out:**
   - Create your own flavor: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
     - Example: `feature/add-login`
3. **Save Your Recipe:**
   - Write what you’ve cooked: `git commit -m "Fix: Resolve login issue"`
4. **Share with the Team:**
   - Push it to the repository: `git push origin <branch-name>`

### **☁️ GitHub Workflow (Sharing Recipes)**

1. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Add a title and description.
   - Link to any related tickets.
2. **Review & Feedback:**
   - Check your team’s comments.
   - Make changes if needed.
3. **Merge:**
   - Bring your flavor into the main branch.

## 📝 Commit Message Guidelines (Used in MNCs)

Clear and descriptive commit messages are essential for teamwork and tracking changes effectively. Follow these rules to craft professional commit messages:

1. **Structure Your Message:**
   - Use the format: `<type>(<scope>): <short description>`
   - Example: `feat(login): Add Google authentication`

2. **Common Types:**
   - **feat:** New features
   - **fix:** Bug fixes
   - **chore:** Maintenance tasks
   - **docs:** Documentation updates
   - **style:** Code style changes (formatting, no code logic changes)
   - **test:** Adding or modifying tests
   - **refactor:** Code changes without feature addition or bug fixes

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Start with a lowercase verb (e.g., "add," "fix").
   - Keep the first line under 50 characters.
   - Include a detailed description if necessary.
   - Reference issue/ticket IDs (e.g., `fix(login): Resolve #123`).

Example:
```
feat(dashboard): Add user analytics widget

Added a new widget to display user analytics on the dashboard, including daily active users and monthly trends.
```

## 🎯 Ticket Management (Your Task Tracker)

Think of tickets as your tea-making to-do list:

1. **Add Tasks:**
   - Clearly describe what needs to be done.
2. **Set Priorities:**
   - Use labels like `High Priority` or `Bug Fix`.
3. **Track Progress:**
   - Move tickets from `To Do` → `In Progress` → `Done`.

## 🛠️ Debugging: Finding the Perfect Brew

Debugging is like tasting your tea and adjusting the sugar. Here’s a simple process:

1. **Recreate the Issue:**
   - Try to see what went wrong.
2. **Check Logs:**
   - Always look for clues in your error messages.
3. **Use Tools:**
   - Tools like Chrome DevTools, Postman, or your editor’s debugger are your best friends.
4. **Ask for Help:**
   - Stuck? Chat with a teammate or mentor.
